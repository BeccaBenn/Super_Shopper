Purpose
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In our role as data analysts, we have been assigned the responsibility of generating forecasts for consumer shopping trends throughout the remainder of the year. Our analysis will be rooted in the data obtained from Quarter 1 and Quarter 2. Working collaboratively as a team, our objective is to delve into category performance, identifying the top-performing categories across prominent retail platforms.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Summary
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Popular Categories: The most sought-after categories include Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry, Home & Kitchen, Books, Electronics, Sports & Outdoors, Tools & Home Improvements, Health & Household, Beauty & Personal Care, Automotive, and Toys & Games.
  
- Audience Attraction Dynamics: The allure of the most popular categories lies in their extensive subcategories, effectively capturing a diverse audience within specific niches. This strategic approach not only enhances the appeal of these categories but also ensures a broader engagement with a varied audience base.

- Seasonal Fluctuations: Following the holiday season, there is a noticeable reduction in the number of categories. However, the data indicates a gradual pickup in category numbers after March, signaling a shift in consumer preferences and purchasing patterns.

Analytical Constraints
-------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to grappling with large file sizes and compressed formats, our analysis was further hindered by the constraints of limited device memory. The combination of these factors necessitated a careful optimization of our analytical processes, ensuring that our methodologies were adapted to accommodate the constraints imposed by the available memory on devices.
